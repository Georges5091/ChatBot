# ChatBot-Test
This chatbot is capable of responding to user queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The `tokenize` function reads and tokenizes text from 'data.txt' into sentences and words. Lemmatization is handled by the `lemmatize_tokens` function, which normalizes words to their base forms. The `preprocess_text` function prepares the text by removing punctuation, tokenizing, and lemmatizing. The chatbot can respond to greetings using predefined inputs and responses. The main functionality is within the `respond` function, which tokenizes input, vectorizes it using TF-IDF, and calculates cosine similarity to find the most relevant response. The `split_input` function divides the user query into individual questions based on delimiters. The `chatbot` function coordinates these steps, handling greetings, splitting input, generating responses, and combining them into a final output.
